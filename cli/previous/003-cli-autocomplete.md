### Commands auto-completion
Support auto-completion of commands in bash. Lesser priority - zsh.

- Pressing Tab when a command/flag is partially typed and there is only one candidate should auto-complete it.
- Pressing Tab when there are multiple candidates should output the candidates and allow to continue typing.

Add a command `completion` to output the completion script. Command name and behavior is taken from similar cases in `kubectl` and `gh` to "build on potential user's expected knowledge" per UNIX philosophy

#### Examples:

Enable auto-completion in current shell:
``` bash
source <(tctl completion bash)
```

Usage:
- type tctl workf and press Tab.
Expected: auto-completes to tctl workflows

`kubectl completion -h`

`gh completion -h`
