### Improve short versions of commands, bring consistency

Currently shorter versions of tctl commands lack in consistency, as an example here is a snippet from `--help`:
``` bash
$ tctl -h

...
- COMMANDS:
   namespace, n       ...
   workflow, wf       ...
   activity, act      ...
   taskqueue, tq      ...
   admin, adm         ...
   cluster, cl        ...
   dataconverter, dc  ...
...
```
As you can see, short versions of commands are randomly different in length. Change the short versions of commands to single characters only. Remove some of the short versions especially for the commands that are expected to be less used.

The above `--help` example will convert to:

``` bash
$ tctl -h

...
- COMMANDS:
   namespace, n       ...
   workflow, w        ...
   activity, a        ...
   taskqueue, t       ...
   admin              ...
   cluster            ...
   dataconverter      ...
...
```

Follow the same principal for:
- sub-commands, ex. `workflow desc` -> `workflow d`. Remove lesser used shorts such as `workflow term` (for terminate sub-command)
- flags, ex. `--print_json` which has a short `--pjson` should be changed to `-j` (for `--json`).
