# [Temporal](https://temporal.io) proposals

This repo tracks all new and accepted feature proposals (internal or external) for the [Temporal open source project](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal). If you're interested in submitting a proposal for consideration, please refer the [Creating a new proposal](#creating-a-new-proposal) section.

### Creating a new proposal

The Temporal proposal process begins when you create an issue adhering to the proposal template. There are some general guidelines we expect all proposal contributors to follow:

* Before you submit a new proposal, please do your best to search through the repo for existing proposals that address a similar problem.
* Proposal must adhere to our [proposal issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/proposal-template.md). Reviewing proposals takes time, having a standard form of submission ensures each proposal gets a fair chance.
* It's important to explain why the proposal is important to Temporal, outside of your specific needs. Temporal is a community project and therefore we will prioritize proposals that most benefit the community.

We appreciate the time and energy it takes to create a well constructed proposal. If you ever feel that your proposal was constructed properly but not given a fair chance, please reach out to us!

If you're struggling to understand what a basic issue proposal will look like, [check out this example issue](https://github.com/temporalio/proposals/issues/1).
