# Ruby SDK - Type hinting, Converters, Codecs and Errors

This proposal goes into details regarding the implementation of data conversion pipeline (including
type hints, converters and codecs) as well as outlines the hierarchy of exception classes.

## Type hinting

The Ruby typing system is not something we can currently rely on for specifying the types of all the
inputs and outputs. Instead we will add custom "annotations" (technically these are just method
calls) to the activity/workflow definitions in order to provide type hinting. Here's the basic
example:

```ruby
class SumActivity < Temporal::Activity
  input Integer, Integer
  output Integer

  def execute(a, b)
    a + b
  end
end
```

We will support most basic Ruby types (e.g. `Integer`, `Float`, `String`, `Symbol`, `Boolean`,
`Array`, `Hash`, etc). This will allow the SDK to perform a runtime check of the arguments and
return values to ensure they match the specified types.

We will also leverage this system to allow SDK users to specify their own types:

```ruby
class MyInput < Struct.new(:a, :b)
  def self.load(hash)
    new(hash['a'], hash['b'])
  end

  def dump
    { 'a' => a, 'b' => b } # explicit for illustration purposes, can use #to_h instead
  end
end

class MyOutput < Struct.new(:sum)
  def self.load(sum)
    new(sum.to_i)
  end

  def dump
    sum.to_s # string used for illustration purposes, can use Integer directly instead
  end
end

class MyWorkflow < Temporal::Workflow
  input MyInput
  output MyOutput

  def execute(input)
    MyOutput.new(input.a + input.b)
  end
end
```

Custom types are expected to implement the following interface:

```ruby
interface _CustomType[U]
  # Take a primitive type and return an instance of the implementing class
  def self.load: (U) -> instance

  # Returns a trivially serializable type representing the custom object
  def dump: -> U
end
```

The same exact concept applies to signals and queries:

```ruby
class MyWorkflow < Temporal::Workflow
  signal :add, input: Integer
  query :get_sum, output: MyOutput

  def execute
    ...
  end
end
```

Notes:

- This feature is 100% optional. Without these definitions the output from converters will be used
  directly as arguments and return values
- The full potential of this solution is obviously limited to a single language SDKs
- When sending a custom input type to another SDK, workflow/activity definitions (without the
  implementation) can still be leveraged
- A custom output type sent to another SDK can still be `dump`ed into a matching JSON or other
  serializable structure
- The same approaches apply to inputs and outputs received from other SDKs


## Payload handling

Ruby SDK will use the model proposed [here](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/concepts/what-is-a-data-converter/)
to distinguish between payload converters and codecs.

The main difference is that a Converter translates between any Ruby object and a Payload, while
a Codec is a lower level construct that encodes/decodes from a Payloads protobuf to a Payloads
protobuf. The former is intended to support specific serialisation formats, while the latter is for
modifying a binary that is transmitted over the wire.


### Converters

A payload converter is expected to implement the following interface:

```ruby
interface _PayloadConverter[U]
  # Returns whether or not it can decode a given Payload
  def can_decode?: (Temporal::Payload) -> Bool

  # Takes any Ruby object and returns a Payload object
  def to_payload: (U) -> Temporal::Payload

  # Takes a Payload object and returns a Ruby object
  # Only called after a positive response from the #can_decode? method
  def from_payload: (Temporal::Payload) -> U
end
```

The SDK will provide an implementation of basic converters â€” Null (for `nil`s), Bytes (any stream of
bytes) and JSON (using the `oj` gem and potentially allowing the SDK user to specify the
[mode](https://github.com/ohler55/oj/blob/develop/pages/Modes.md)). We will also provide a
`Composite` converter to combine multiple converters behind the same interface.

To signal the `Composite` converter that a converter is unable to encode provided data it should
throw a `Temporal::IncompatibleData` error. In this case the `Composite` converter will try the
other converters it was initialized with.


### Codecs

And a payload codec is expected to implement this interface:

```ruby
interface _PayloadCodec
  # Takes an array of Payload objects and returns an array of encoded Payload object
  # The resulting Array is expected to hold at least one Payload
  def encode: (Array[Temporal::Payload]) -> Array[Temporal::Payload]

  # Takes an array of Payloads object and returns an array of decoded Payload object
  # The resulting Array is expected to hold at least one Payload
  def decode: (Array[Temporal::Payload]) -> Array[Temporal::Payload]
end
```


### Configuring client/worker

In order to use the defined converters and codecs, these need to be supplied to a client and worker.

```ruby
converter = Temporal::Converters::Composite.new(
  Temporal::Converters::Null,
  Temporal::Converters::Bytes,
  MyProtobufConverter.new
)
codecs = [EncryptionCodec.new(KEY_ID), CompressionCodec]

connection = Temporal::Connection.new('http://localhost:7233')
client = Temporal::Client.new(
  connection,
  'my-namespace',
  payload_converter: converter,
  payload_codecs: codecs
)

worker = Temporal::Worker.new(
  connection,
  namespace: 'demo',
  task_queue: 'demo',
  workflows: [...],
  activities: [...],
  payload_converter: converter,
  payload_codecs: codecs
)
```

*This does indeed involve some duplication and we might simplify this initialization later
on. But it's outside the scope for this proposal.*

Notes:

- Converters and codecs both can be classes and class instances as long as the given object
  implements the required interface
- This API is still being figured out to accommodate future features and configuration params


## Data conversion

All the previously outlined modules are required to facilitate the process of data conversion.
Here's the diagram representing it:

![Data conversion](./images/data-conversion.png)

This describes the process that every piece of data (workflow/activity args and return values,
signal inputs, query results, headers, memos, etc) goes through getting transformed from the
user-land object to something that can be transmitted over the wire.

*NOTE: As mentioned previously, the "Type hints" are optional and will be omitted altogether unless
defined.*

The reverse process is applied when converting the data from a protobuf received over the wire back
to a use-land object.


## Errors

Here's the Error hierarchy that is planned for the Ruby SDK:

```ruby
module Temporal
  # top level error superclass
  class Error < StandardError

  # superclass for all errors within the SDK itself
  class InternalError < Error

  # errors specific to Client
  class ClientError < Error

  # errors specific to Worker
  class WorkerError < InternalError

  # superclass for connection and network errors
  class RPCError < Error

  # superclass for errors related to the server and it's responses
  class ServerError < Error
  class UnexpectedError < ServerError

  # superclass for all API failure responses
  class APIError < ServerError

  # type hinting errors
  class TypeError < Error

  # superclass for workflow errors
  class WorkflowError < Error

  # superclass for activity errors
  class ActivityError < Error
```

Notes:

- This list is not exhaustive, more errors will be added as parts of the SDK are getting built
- Some concrete error class placement might be confusing and will be clarified later in the process
