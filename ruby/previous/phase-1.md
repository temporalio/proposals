# Ruby SDK - Phase 1

Ruby is a popular dynamic programming language that many companies are leaning on to beat their
competitors to the market. With the focus on the speed of execution it is very common for these
companies to rely on managed solutions. This presents an opportunity for Temporal to become Ruby's
de facto standard for workflow orchestration.


## Timeline

The Ruby SDK will be implemented in four loosely defined phases:

- Phase 1 — initial setup, activity APIs, client and worker, payload converters
- Phase 2 — per-class execution attributes, logging, metrics, error handling, middleware
- Phase 3 — workflow APIs, local activities, async activity completion, etc
- Phase 4 — Sandbox, replayer, support for testing


## Overview

The Ruby SDK will be implemented on top of the [SDK Core](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core).
The exact bridging mechanism will be decided later as there are different alternatives.

### Goals

- Quick path to a full working setup
- A path of minimal divergence from other SDKs (does allow for other approaches, but it's not the
  goal)
- Minimise external dependencies (gems)
- Local and end-to-end testability of workflows
- Type safety where possible (optional and exact approach to be chosen later)
- Compatibility with existing tools (error handling, logging, metrics, middleware, etc)

### Non-goals

- Convention over configuration (in favour of cross-SDK interface consistency, this goes against
  Ruby principles)
- Backwards compatibility with Coinbase's Ruby SDK (current SDK customers will have to do a full
  migration)
- Reducing the number of different approaches to achieving the same goal (let the SDK user choose
  what's best for their application/taste)

### Tech stack && approach

- Ruby version >= 2.7 (currently oldest fully supported version)
- Type safety based on RBS or Sorbet (RBS will require Ruby version => 3.0)
- Packaged as a Ruby gem (and published to [https://rubygems.org])
- FFI or Rutie bridge into SDK Core (to be decided)


## Key language considerations and restrictions

We're assuming that the audience for this proposal might not be intimately familiar with Ruby. So
before we jump into the main part here are some important considerations to keep in mind to avoid
confusion during the discussion.

*NOTE: The provided examples are not implying these are correct or incorrect ways of using Ruby, but
simply demonstrate language specifics.*

### Method invocations

All parentheses in Ruby are optional (despite the presence or absence of method arguments). So these
calls are identical:

```ruby
my_method()
my_method
```

As well as these:

```ruby
my_method(a, b, c)
my_method a, b, c
```

The most common style suggests not using parentheses when there are no arguments and using them
otherwise. This rule is often ignored in a case of a DSL
(e.g. [RSpec](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs/built-in-matchers)).

### Global scope

Unlike other dynamic languages Ruby does not support requiring (or importing) files into a local
scope. In practice that mean that everything that gets `require`d becomes globally available from
every single part of the application. This applies to everything including constants, variables,
methods, classes and modules. Here's an example:

my_method.rb:

```ruby
def my_method(name)
  puts "Hello World, #{name}!"
end
```

my_class.rb:

```ruby
class MyClass
  def run
    my_method('Alice')
  end
end
```

main.rb:

```ruby
require './my_method.rb'
require './my_class.rb'

MyClass.new.run
```

Running `ruby main.rb` will print `Hello World, Alice!`.

### "Monkey" patching

In case of a variable or a method name collision the last definition overrides the previous one
without hesitation. Same principle applies to methods defined on a class, but not the class itself —
class definitions are merged together resulting in an altered class definition in the global scope.

```ruby
class MyClass
  def my_method
    puts 'Hello World!'
  end
end

class MyClass
  def my_method
    puts 'Hello Monkeys!'
  end

  def new_method
    puts 'Hello New World!'
  end
end

my = MyClass.new
my.my_method
# => Hello Monkeys!
my.new_method
# => Hello New World
```

### Concurrency

Ruby can be a tricky language for running concurrent applications. It supports kernel threads,
however it has a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in place which prevents any two threads to be
executed at the same time (making it effectively single-threaded). The good news is that GIL does
allow IO-bound instructions to be executed in parallel.

While threads can offer a great performance boost in applications with a significant IO reliance. In
order to effectively utilise a multi-core processor a Ruby application has to be executed using
multiple processes.

#### Fibers

Ruby also has Fibers that allow light weight cooperative concurrency. These are code blocks that can
be paused (from inside) and resumed (from outside). These are really useful for controlling the
execution of workflow code. However unlike threads Fibers are never preempted and their scheduling
has to be done manually by the code:

```ruby
fiber = Fiber.new do
  i = 0
  loop do
    i += 1
    puts i
    Fiber.yield
  end
end

fiber.resume
# => 1
fiber.resume
# => 2
fiber.resume
# => 3
```

*NOTE: Each `fiber.resume` call blocks the main thread until a Fiber `yield`s back control.*

#### Reactors

Somewhat less popular, but still very viable are libraries that implement a reactor pattern for
building concurrent applications (e.g. Async or EventMachine). These libraries allow users to
concurrently execute IO operations.

There are however quite a few big limitations to this approach:

- You need to use very specific libraries to perform IO calls this way (there isn't one for gRPC)
- Any CPU-bound instructions block the reactor and therefore need to be executed in small bursts per
  reactor tick
- Any user-defined code can block the whole thing and has to be wrapped in threads anyways


## A basic end-to-end example

Perhaps a bit unconventionally (as far as the proposal review process goes), but we'd like to start
with an end-to-end example of a simple and fully functional "Hello World" workflow. The intention of
this example is to demonstrate how everything ties together before diving into each separate moving
part and exploring it in depth.

```ruby
require 'temporal'
require 'temporal/worker'

class MyActivity < Temporal::Activity
  def execute(name)
    puts "Hello World, #{name}!"
  end
end

class MyWorkflow < Temporal::Workflow
  def execute(name)
    # This part is outside of the scope of the 1st phase of the proposal
    MyActivity.execute!(name, options: { task_queue: 'my-queue' })
  end
end

config = Temporal::Configuration.new(
  url: 'localhost:7233',
  namespace: 'my-namespace'
)

client = Temporal::Client.new(config)
client.start_workflow(MyWorkflow, 'Alice', options: {
  id: 'my-workflow-id',
  task_queue: 'my-queue'
})

worker = Temporal::Worker.new(
  config,
  task_queue: 'my-queue',
  workflows: [MyWorkflow],
  activities: [MyActivity]
)
worker.run
```


## Client

The client is the primary point for interacting with workflows and async activities as well as
managing namespaces. A client is created with a configuration object that specifies options shared
between a worker and a client.

```ruby
config = Temporal::Configuration.new(url: 'localhost:7233', namespace: 'my-namespace')
client = Temporal::Client.new(config)

client.start_workflow(MyWorkflow, 'arg_1', kwarg_2: 'foo', options: {
  id: 'my-id',
  task_queue: 'my-queue'
})
```

Notes:

- Client is bound to a namespace provided through the configuration
- Configuration will provide defaults where possible (avoiding extensive upfront configuration)
- Configuration will be used for other more advanced options such as logger, metrics, payload
  converters, middleware, etc

```ruby
class Temporal::Client
  # Creates a new instance of a Client
  def self.new(config: Temporal::Configuration, **options) -> Temporal::Client

  # Start the workflow and return handle for further interaction
  # TODO: expand on :workflow
  def start_workflow(
    workflow, # workflow class or a name
    *args, # any args to be passed as the input to the workflow
    options: {}, # execution options
    **kwargs # keyword arguments as inputs will be supported later
  ) -> Temporal::WorkflowHandle

  # Start the workflow and block awaiting it's completion
  def execute_workflow(
    workflow, # workflow class or a name
    *args, # any args to be passed as the input to the workflow
    options: {}, # execution options
    **kwargs # keyword arguments as inputs will be supported later
  ) -> Any

  # Generate a handle object from a workflow_id and an optional run_id or first_execution_run_id
  def workflow_handle(workflow_id, run_id: nil, first_execution_run_id: nil)
    -> Temporal::WorkflowHandle
end
```

Notes:

- This is not a complete definition of the client
- Only positional arguments are supported in Phase 1
- Keyword arguments will be supported in the future, except for the reserved `options:`
- Conventions similar to Python SDK are used here:
  - `Client` is a general purpose interface, not limited workflow-only interactions
  - Due to this method names are more descriptive than just `#start`, `#execute`, etc
  - `Client#execute_workflow` is added for convenience

Once a workflow is started all the interactions will be going through the handle object returned to
the caller. The handle can of course be created from a workflow_id/run_id combination using the
`Client#workflow_handle` method. Example:


```ruby
handle = client.start_workflow(MyWorkflow, options: { id: 'my-id', task_queue: 'my-queue' })
execution_info = handle.describe
handle.result
```

Here the interface of the handle:

```ruby
class Temporal::WorkflowHandle
  attr_reader id: String
  attr_reader run_id: String

  # Return the result of the workflow execution or raise if a workflow is still running after
  #   waiting for for up to :timeout seconds.
  # - follow_runs is set to true by default and will loop through all executions in a chain until it
  #   finds the last one returning its result
  # - Passing timeout: nil will not wait if the working is still running
  def result(follow_runs: Bool, timeout: Integer) -> Any

  # Returns more information about a workflow
  def describe() -> Temporal::WorkflowExecutionInfo

  # Sends a cancellation request
  def cancel() -> void

  # Sends a query and awaits for the response
  def query(name, *args) -> Any

  # Sends a signal
  def signal(name, *args) -> void

  # Terminates a workflow
  def terminate(reason, details: nil) -> void
end
```

### Alternatives considered

After a few discussions we have settled on a namespaced `Client` being the default client to
maintain consistency with other SDKs. This however should not prevent someone from building other
types of Clients (e.g. multi-tenant that is not bound to a single namespace).


## Worker

The worker interface allows SDK users to start processing registered workflow and activities. These
will then be polled for on the specified namespaces & task queues and executed.

```ruby
config = Temporal::Configuration.new(url: 'localhost:7233', namespace: 'my-namespace')

worker_1 = Temporal::Worker.new(
  config,
  task_queue: 'my-task-queue',
  workflows: [MyWorkflow], # uses 'MyWorkflow' as a name unless specified in the workflow class
  activities: [MyActivity] # uses 'MyActivity' as a name unless specified in the workflow class
)
worker_1.start

# example of an activity-only worker
worker_2 = Temporal::Worker.new(config, task_queue: 'my-task-queue-2', activities: [MyActivity])
worker_2.start

# later
worker_1.stop
worker_2.stop
```

Notes:

- This is not complete example of all configuration options for a worker
- A worker will use the workflow/activity class name as a name unless it is explicitly provided (
  `worker_2` demonstrated this approach)
- Each worker will run in its own thread
- A blocking `Worker#run` method will be available for convenience of running a single worker in
  a process until SIGTERM or SIGINT is received
- In case connection sharing is a concern we can create and memoize a connection on the instance of
  Temporal::Configuration

And here is the `Worker` interface:

```ruby
class Worker
  # Create a new instance of a Worker
  def self.new(
    config: Temporal::Configuration,
    task_queue: String, # a task queue for polling workflow and activity tasks from
    workflows: [Workflow], # list of workflows to handle
    activities: [Activity], # list of activity to handle
    thread_pool: Temporal::ThreadPool # optional thread-pool for sharing between multiple workers
  ) -> Worker

  # Start the worker and block until the process exits
  def run() -> void

  # Start the worker asynchronously
  def start() -> void

  # Gracefully stop the worker (wait for all running workflow/activities to finish)
  def stop() -> void
end
```

Internally each worker will create a thread for task polling as well as a thread pool of a given
size (passed to the initializer as an optional `:threads` argument). A thread pool can optionally be
provided by the caller allowing to share the same thread pool between multiple workers. Then each
activity task will be dispatched to an available thread (via an in-memory queue). To make sure a
polling worker always has processing capacity a polling request will only be dispatched if there is
an available thread in the pool (in other words the pool will have no buffer).

A very similar model will be used for workflow tasks, with an added complexity of wrapping each
workflow in its own Fiber (inside a thread). This serves two purposes:

1. A workflow code can be paused and resumed during the history replay
2. Sticky workflows can be left paused while waiting for the next workflow task

Given that Fibers are very lightweight this will allow us to keep many stick workflows efficiently
in memory and manage accordingly to the worker configuration.

Here's a diagram to demonstrate the whole setup:

<img src="./ruby_threads.png" width="400" align="center" alt="Temporal" />

### Alternatives considered

We've decided against using the `Client` to initialise the `Worker` (something that Go and Python
SDKs are doing). It seemed like a wrong abstraction and would require making many attributes public
on the client to make sure the worker can access them (expanding the public API of a client). Using
a configuration object solves this and opens up further optimisation opportunities (that will be
proposed in the 2nd phase).

We can potentially use the reactor pattern via Async gem. This has the benefit of giving extra
performance, however it would drastically reduce the performance unless activities are written in a
reactor-friendly way. This can be further added as an optional approach to apps already using Async,
but doesn't feel like a great default option.

Additionally the SDK users will want to leverage multiple CPUs by spawning multiple worker
processes. We have agreed that this part should be left out of the Ruby SDK and handled by
developers themselves. Potentially this functionality can be added as a separate Ruby gem.


## Activities

Each activity is going to be represented by its own class. This decision comes with a few benefits:

- There's no need to pollute global scope with activity methods (see "Global Scope" section)
- There's no need to inject global context for communicating with Temporal. It will be available
  through a private variable on the class instance (`#activity`)
- It plays nicely with Ruby's OOP model
- It allows for future extensibility including 3rd party extensions
- Activity can be easily tested by injecting a test context into the class instead of the real one

By default we'll use the name of the class as activity name (when communicating with the server).
This is of course overridable in case the SDK users would like to use their own naming schema. And
we'll use the method `#execute` as the primary entrypoint for executing user code.

```ruby
class MyActivity < Temporal::Activity
  activity 'my-activity' # custom name

  def execute(arg_1, arg_2: nil)
    loop do
      sleep 1
      activity.logger.info('❤️')
      activity.logger.debug("Attempt #{activity.info.attempts}")
      activity.heartbeat('details')
    end
  rescue Temporal::Error::CancellationRequested
    activity.logger.info('💀')
    # Accept cancellation request
    raise Temporal::Error::ActivityCancelled, 'cancellation details here'
  end
end
```

Notes:

- A custom activity name can be specified using `activity 'my-activity'` call (we can't use name,
  because it is reserved to the actual class name in Ruby)
- `activity` within `#execute` is an instance of `Temporal::Activity::Context`
- `activity.logger` will use a logging adapter configure via `Temporal::Configuration` (more on
  this in the 2nd phase)
- Common logging context can be configured by using middleware (more on this in the 2nd phase)
- `activity.heartbeat` is a synchronous call
- In case of a cancellation request `Temporal::Error::CancellationRequested` will get raised, which
  can be accepted by raising `Temporal::Error::ActivityCancelled`

```ruby
class Temporal::Activity::Context
  # Access to a pre-configured logger
  def logger() -> Temporal::Logger

  # Heartbeat will raise if a cancellation was requested
  def heartbeat(*details) -> void

  # Provides access to extra details from PollActivityTaskQueueResponse
  def info() -> Temporal::Info::Activity
end
```

### Return values and errors

An activity can communicate its result to the workflow by returning a value or raising an error. The
return values will get serialized as a `Payload` object similar to activity input arguments.
Similarly, an error will get serialized and re-raised from within the workflow (if an activity
called "synchronously").

The main idea here is to make it feel (from the workflow's perspective) like a local invocation of
an activity without any additional constructs in the way.

```ruby
class MakePaymentActivity < Temporal::Activity
  PaymentMethodNotFound = Class.new(Temporal::Error::ActivityFailure)
  PaymentFailed = Class.new(Temporal::Error::ActivityFailure)

  def execute(payment_method_id)
    payment_method = PaymentMethod.find(payment_method_id)
    raise UserNotFound, "No payment_method with id #{payment_method_id}" unless payment_method

    result = PaymentService.execute(user.payment_method)
    raise PaymentFailed, "Unable to process payment: #{result.error}" if result.failure?

    result.payment_id
  end
end
```

Notes:

- Errors defined within the activity class are namespaced as `MyActivity::PaymentFailed`,
  which is a very useful property
  - This will however not work if a workflow does not have access to the activity definition
  - In this case it will get raised as a generic `Temporal::Error::ActivityFailure` with an original
    error's class name available via `#original_error`
- Subclassing `Temporal::Error::ActivityFailure` allows us to inject extra information into the
  error (such as activity name, id, etc)
- All errors will also have their backtrace serialized and relayed to the caller


## Payload converters

Ruby SDK will use the model proposed [here](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/concepts/what-is-a-data-converter/)
to facilitate conversion between SDK inputs and payloads. Basically there will be two extension
points on the `Temporal::Configuration` object allowing to add either a Converter or a Codec.

The main difference is that a Converter translates between any Ruby object and a Payload, while
a Codec is a lower level construct that encodes/decodes from a Payloads protobuf to a Payloads
protobuf. The former is intended to support specific serialisation formats, while the later is for
modifying a binary that is transmitted over the wire.

```ruby
config = Temporal::Configuration.new(url: 'localhost:7933') do |c|
  # Use your own converter
  c.payload_converter = MarshallConverter # can be a class/module based on duck-typing
  # Or combine your own converter with the ones provided
  c.payload_converter = Temporal::Converters::Composite.new(
    Temporal::Converters::Null,
    Temporal::Converters::Bytes,
    MyProtobufConverter.new
  )
  # The codecs will be applied in the exact order they were provided
  c.payload_codecs = [EncryptionCodec.new(KEY_ID), CompressionCodec]
end
```

Notes:

- Using a block here allows for flexible converter/codec setup, while keeping the configuration
  object itself immutable after initialization
- By calling `<<` we don't force the SDK users to reinitialize default converters

A payload converter is expected to have this interface:

```ruby
class Temporal::PayloadConverter::Base
  # Returns whether or not it can decode a given Payload
  def can_decode?(payload: Temporal::Payload) -> Bool

  # Takes any Ruby object and returns a Payload object or nil if unable to convert
  def to_payload(data: Any) -> Temporal::Payload

  # Takes a Payload object and returns a Ruby object. Only called on a matching encoding
  def from_payload(payload: Temporal::Payload) -> Any
end
```

And a codec is expected to have this interface:

```ruby
class Temporal::PayloadCodec::Base
  # Takes Payloads object and returns a modified Payloads object
  def encode(payloads: [Temporal::Payload]) -> [Temporal::Payload]

  # Takes Payloads object and returns a modified Payloads object
  def decode(payloads: [Temporal::Payload]) -> [Temporal::Payload]
end
```

### Alternatives considered

While some other SDKs combine these two constructs into one with a broader interface we think that
these are different enough concepts that deserve first-class separation. Otherwise implementing
Codecs becomes a tricky task where each Codec needs to be aware of all the Converters available.

We also considered hiding the `Composite` converter from the SDK users and only allow them to
provide concrete converters. This was rejected because there might be a use-case when a top-level
converter needs to be fully replaced.
